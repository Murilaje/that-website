        The witches brew a pot of hate with lizard, <br>
        but and man with a smile they laugh their spells astir with wretched hand calling demons baphomet <br>
        and Mephistopheles the tattered firyres cackle as their mortal victims bleed don't burn the witch the ways of hell <br>
        aren't wrong don't burn the witch let them brew their song the witches of the blackened arts are cunning, cruel and mean persecuted by religion God the <br>
        man unseen beastial malevolence is chartered in their bones leave the unreal house of God and burn in hell at home don't burn the witch the ways of hell<br>
         aren't wrong don't burn the witch let them brew their song eye of lizard wing of bat testicle of man tongue of eagle brain of rat Jesus Christ's left hand the<br>
          witches make the voodoo doll a toy taboo in heaven they dance around the pentagram in search of rape by Satan leave the heart and blood of men in cauldrons laced <br>
          in sin add the arsenic, hemlock, pus triumph takes the wings</pre>
